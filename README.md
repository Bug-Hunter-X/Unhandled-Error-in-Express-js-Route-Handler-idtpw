This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling.  The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fails to handle the case where the user ID is invalid (e.g., not a number).  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in Express.js applications to ensure stability and prevent crashes.
